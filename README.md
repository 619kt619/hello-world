# hello-world
New to the space. Looking to learn, create and collaborate

My name is Kirk and my favorite number is 4
I am an Apprentice to Electrician's and I am interested in the electronics space
Looking to develop smart devices and do whole home automation/control systems for my clients

I like to be active and eat as healthy as possible
I want to start gardening and my first project to is build an environment monitoring/control system to log data and ensure proper growing conditons

Other interests include driving/racing (legally), sports, surfing, cannabis, and playing video/board games.

If we have anything in common or not shoot me an email and let's shoot the shit. I feel the best experienced gained is from listening to others stories. Tell me a little about yours
